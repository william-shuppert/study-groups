        <p>
          Academic pressure can come in the form of rigorous coursework, demanding assignments, and the constant pursuit of academic excellence. This can create an overwhelming environment for students. Concurrently, the absence of a solid social support system further intensifies these challenges. Navigating the intricacies of coursework becomes even more daunting when students lack a community to share experiences, seek advice, or collaborate on their academic journeys. This problem can have a large impact on a studentâ€™s overall well-being and academic success. Due to the importance of these social interactions, and their connections to us, as Miami University students, we have decided that there is a need to research potential systems that could simplify the process of finding groups to study and hangout with at university.
